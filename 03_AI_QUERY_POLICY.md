03_AI_QUERY_POLICY.mdAI Query Scope & Handling Policy1. Purpose of the PolicyThis document defines the baseline for the query handling scope of the Daiso In-store AI Product Location Guide Service.The objectives are:To fix the functional scope to prevent "scope creep" during development.To clearly distinguish between Supported Intents and Intentional Out-of-Scope queries.To provide a consistent User Experience (UX) for unsupported queries.To serve as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for designing STT, NLU, Agents, and RAG systems.2. Service AssumptionsThis service is strictly limited to the following:"Automating location-related queries that customers frequently ask staff members within the store."Consequently, this AI:Does not function as a general Customer Service (CS) center.Does not explain store management policies.Is not a general-purpose conversational AI (Chit-chat).3. Intent Classification SchemaUser utterances are classified based on "Intent," not sentence structure.3.1 Supported IntentsA. Product Search IntentQueries that can be directly mapped to product/location information.Specific Product Names: e.g., "Where are the scrubbers?"Category-based: e.g., "Where is the bathroom supplies section?"Usage/Functional Descriptions: e.g., "Where is the thing you put in front of the bathroom to absorb water?"Output: Product/Category classification -> Candidate search -> In-store location guidance.3.2 Exceptional Supported Intents (Fixed Locations)Although not "product searches," these are handled as they are high-frequency staff queries.B. Fixed Location IntentTargets: Restrooms, Checkout counters (POS), Entrances/Exits.Handling: Direct response based on pre-registered static location data, bypassing complex RAG/NLU logic.3.3 Unsupported Intents (Out-of-Scope)C. Store Operation IntentTypes: Delivery availability, Exchange/Refund policies, Operating hours.Reason: These vary by branch or are subject to frequent policy changes.Examples: "Do you deliver?", "How do I return this?", "What time do you close?"D. General / Irrelevant IntentSmall talk, personal questions, or AI performance testing.3.4 Low-Quality Input & Noise Handling PolicyThe following STT outputs are not considered valid queries:Extremely Short Utterances: e.g., "Ah," "Um..."Repetitive/Meaningless Noise: e.g., "Testing, testing," "Lalalala."Non-linguistic Inputs: Profanity, laughter, or unintelligible sentence structures.Action: Bypass NLU/RAG and trigger a Re-prompting UX.Response Example: "I'm sorry, I didn't catch 그that. Could you please tell me the name of the product you are looking for?"4.

System Logic Flow (Placement)The policy evaluation occurs between the STT and NLU stages.User Voice → STT (Text)Policy Evaluation (Gatekeeper)IF Valid Intent: Route to NLU → RAG → Response.IF Fixed Location: Direct Mapping → Response.IF Unsupported/Noise: Trigger Fallback/Refusal Response.6. UX Response Principles for Unsupported QueriesDo not return a system error.Do not remain silent.Polite Deflection + Re-stating Service Scope: > "This service specializes in finding products and locations within the store. Please tell me the name of the item or place you are looking for!"7. Future Considerations (Phase 1+)The following may be moved to "Supported" in future phases via 10_DECISION_LOG.md:FAQ for Store Operations.Staff Call-bell integration.Real-time stock level integration.8. Success Metrics for PoCLeakage Prevention: Zero unsupported queries reaching the RAG/Agent stage.Accuracy: Correct classification of "Functional Descriptions" into product categories.Robustness: Stable handling of STT noise via the Re-prompting logic.
